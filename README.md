# Restaurant Reviews App


## Project Overview

The spec for this **Restaurant Reviews** project for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree was to incrementally convert a static webpage to a **mobile-ready web application**. The static design lacked accessibility and was not responsive.

The purpose was to demonstrate how to add responsive CSS so the application is **responsive** and implement accessibility features in the site HTML to ensure it is **accessible** for screen reader use.

To begin a seamless **offline experience** for users, a **service worker** also needed to be implemented.


## Running the project

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/josephine-mattina/restaurant-reviews-app).

2. In a terminal, cd into the project folder. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. I have used Python as provided with the starter code:
 - Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
